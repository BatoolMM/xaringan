An R package for creating slideshows with [remark.js](http://remarkjs.com) through R Markdown. The package name **xaringan** comes from [Sharingan](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sharingan), a d≈çjutsu in Naruto with two abilities: the "Eye of Insight" and the "Eye of Hypnotism". A presentation ninja should have these basic abilities, and I think remark.js may help you acquire these abilities, even if you are not a member of the Uchiha clan.
